# GraphQL

We aim to keep our GraphQL clients, queries and mutations in a single place to be used as a reference for the Skylark API. If you're trying to recreate functionality from the Skylark App, you should be able to find it in this directory.

_Note: If you are unable to locate it here, the query/mutation was probably dynamically generated._
