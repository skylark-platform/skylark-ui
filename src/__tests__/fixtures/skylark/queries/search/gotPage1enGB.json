In Qarth, inside the House of the Undying, Daenerys enters a simulacrum of a destroyed Iron Throne room, then is reunited with what appears to be Khal Drogo and their infant son. Knowing it is unreal, she leaves and successfully retrieves her dragons, who fatally burn Pree, who tries to imprison her.

Sandor Clegane leads the defense outside the gate, but is defeated and retreats inside, denouncing Joffrey and leaving. Joffrey retreats in fear as Tyrion rallies the Gold Cloaks into fighting with him. Stannis' forces enter the castle, but Tyrion leads his men behind Stannis' forces via tunnels and mounts a rearguard attack. Cersei goes to the throne room with Tommen, intending to kill him to save him from being captured. Shae convinces Sansa to hide in her chamber. Sandor Clegane offers to take Sansa to Winterfell, but she refuses to leave.

Bran uses his warg ability to save Jon, who kills Orell before escaping, leaving a furious Ygritte behind with chief Tormund. Osha, Rickon, and his direwolf, Shaggydog, depart for the Last Hearth, while Bran, Meera, Jojen, Hodor and Bran's direwolf, Summer, plan to go beyond the Wall. Daenerys sends Jorah, Naharis, and Grey Worm to infiltrate Yunkai and open the city gate for her army. Yunkai slaves willingly surrender to her forces.

Walder appears to accept his apology while Edmure marries Roslin Frey, Walder's sole pretty granddaughter. After the newlyweds leave the feast, Walder's men murder Catelyn, Talisa and the Stark bannermen, while Roose Bolton, now a Lannister loyalist, kills Robb.

One is for Jaime, who grieves the loss of his sword hand and Cersei's love, and the other is a wedding present for King Joffrey, which Joffrey names Widow's Wail. Prince Oberyn Martell, representing his infirmed brother, Prince Doran of Dorne, arrives in King's Landing to attend the royal wedding. He and his paramour, Ellaria Sand, are greeted by Tyrion. Oberyn secretly seeks revenge against the Lannisters and Gregor Clegane for the rape and murder of his sister, Elia, wife of the unfaithful Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. In the North, Styr and the cannibalistic Thenns reinforce Tormund, Ygritte and the other Wildlings. Maester Aemon absolves Jon after he explains his actions while with the Wildlings and reveals that their army of 100,000 plans to attack Castle Black. In the Riverlands, the Hound and Arya head to the Eyrie where the Hound intends to ransom Arya to her Aunt Lysa, Jon Arryn's widow. Along the way, Arya reclaims her sword, Needle, from Polliver, killing him. In Essos, Daenerys marches her army towards Meereen, the last of the three great slave cities; she fears she is losing control over her growing dragons, now horse-sized.",

The Wildlings attack from both sides of the wall. Tormund's army breaks through from the south and engages the Night's Watch. A giant breaches the tunnel into Castle Black but is killed by Grenn and five others, at the cost of their own lives. Alliser Thorne joins the fight in the southern part, leaving the incompetent Janos Slynt commanding the Wall. Slynt leaves Jon in charge, and as the tide turns at the Wall, Jon joins the fight below. After seeing Jon kill Styr, Ygritte aims her bow at him but hesitates, then is fatally shot by Olly. Assisted by Ghost, Jon's direwolf, the Night's Watch secure Castle Black's inner keep, and a wounded Tormund is arrested. The wall climbers are obliterated by a massive swinging scythe. The Wildlings retreat for the night. Jon goes beyond the Wall to find and kill Mance Rayder, believing that the Wildling army will fragment without his command.",

The witch also predicts Cersei will have three children and her king husband will have twenty. In the present, Tywin is buried, and Lancel Lannister returns, now a devoted convert of a fanatical religious cult called the \"Sparrows\". In Pentos on Essos, a despondent Tyrion accompanies Varys to Meereen to meet Daenerys, who Varys believes may be worthy of the Iron Throne. In Meereen, the insurgent \"Sons of the Harpy\" murder an Unsullied. Daenerys angrily resists restoring old local traditions, including reopening the fighting pits. Missandei asks Grey Worm about why some Unsullied visit brothels. Daenerys visits her two confined dragons, who act aggressively toward her. In the Vale, Littlefinger puts Robin in House Royce's care when he and Sansa depart. At the Wall, Stannis Baratheon seeks to recruit the Wildlings in his war against Roose Bolton, offering citizenship and land as a reward. Jon is unable to persuade Mance Rayder to \"bend the knee\" to Stannis. As Mance is burned alive, Jon ends his agony with an arrow to the heart.",

Catelyn remains at Winterfell to care for the still unconscious Bran. An assassin attacks Bran, but Catelyn fends him off and Bran's direwolf, Summer, kills him. Catelyn suspects the Lannisters were behind the attack. Ned's illegitimate son, Jon, heads north with his uncle, Benjen Stark, to join the Night's Watch, the protectors of the Wall, a massive ice structure that keeps the Wildling tribes and the mythical White Walkers from civilized Westeros. Before departing, Jon gave tomboy Arya a thin sword she names, \"Needle\". Queen Cersei's younger brother, Tyrion Lannister, a dwarf also known as \"The Imp,\" accompanies Jon to the Wall. In King's Landing, Prince Joffrey threatens Arya's young commoner friend, later having him killed. Nymeria, Arya's direwolf, defends her, biting Joffrey. Cersei demands that Robert have the wolf killed, but Arya releases Nymeria to the wild. Sansa's direwolf, Lady, is killed instead. In Winterfell, Brandon awakens, remembering nothing about his fall. Meanwhile, Daenerys is befriended by Ser Jorah Mormont, a disgraced knight, while she focuses on learning how to please Drogo.",

At sea, Littlefinger reveals his complicity in Joffrey's death to Sansa. Before leaving King's Landing, Olenna implies to Margaery that she poisoned Joffrey. She urges Margaery to marry Tommen before Cersei can turn him against her. Jaime believes Tyrion is innocent, but Cersei is adamant he is guilty and also orders Jaime to locate and kill Sansa as an accomplice. Jaime instead sends Brienne to find and protect Sansa, presenting her with new armor, his Valyrian sword, which she names Oath Keeper, horses and a squire, Podrick Payne, Tyrion's former servant. In the North, hoping to eliminate Jon, Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt agree to allow Jon to lead the expedition against the mutineers. Unknown to Jon, the mutineers have captured Bran and his companions. Further north, a White Walker takes Craster's last newborn son to a secret ritual site where he is transformed into a Walker.",

Bran learns he will never walk again and remains unable to remember the events leading to his fall. Jon struggles to adapt to life on the Wall. The once elite Night's Watch now recruits many low-born and/or convicted criminals who are unimpressed by Jon's bloodline.

At the Wall, Jeor Mormont gives his family Valyrian steel sword to Jon in gratitude; Maester Aemon reveals to Jon that Aemon is a Targaryen. In Essos, Drogo's wound becomes septic and his death imminent. Daenerys asks a mystic slave woman to use blood magic to save him. The woman tells everyone to remain outside the tent until after the spell is cast. Daenerys goes into labor, and Jorah brings her into the tent seeking aid. Robb sacrifices 2,000 soldiers to fight the Lannister army as a diversion so he can move his army and capture Jaime. In a public hearing, Ned confesses to treason and publicly affirms Joffrey is the rightful heir. However, rather than sparing his life as negotiated, the vengeful and increasingly insane Joffrey has him decapitated, while Sansa, Cersei, and other counselors object futilely. Sansa is forced to watch her father die while Arya is nearby in the crowd.",
